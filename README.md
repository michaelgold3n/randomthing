# ClauseWise

## An AI Legal Document Analyzer

## What it Does: 
Analyzes contracts, legal agreements, or terms of service documents to identify key clauses, obligations, and potential risks.

## RAG Component: 
The system could retrieve relevant case laws, legal precedents, or interpretations from a large legal corpus, providing context or recommendations alongside the analysis.

### Why It’s Cool: 
This project demonstrates a deep understanding of both NLP and the legal field, which can be a significant asset for companies focused on RegTech or legal AI solutions.
